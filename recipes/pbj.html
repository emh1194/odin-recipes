        <p class="text">
            The peanut butter and jelly sandwich (casually known
            as the pb and j) is an American classic.
            <br>
            Mom's from sea to shining sea have been serving up these bad boys
            and putting smiles on kids faces since the pioneer days, baby,
            <br>
            and I'm going to lay out the deets you need to make a pb and j of
            your very own. No mother required.
        </p>

        <h3 class="head">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="text">
            <li>
                Peanutbutter
            </li>
            <li>
                Jelly
            </li>
            <li>
                Bread
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="head">Steps</h3>
        <ol class="text">
            <li>
                Slap a piece of bread down right in front of you.
            </li>
            <li>
                Grab hold of a knife, plunge it into the peanut butter, and
                kinda swirl it around until you've got a nice, big glob of the
                stuff on your utencil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spread that sweet, sweet goop all the way to the outer
                edges of your bread.
            </li>
            <li>
                You more or less do the same thing with the jelly that you
                just did with the peanut butter, except I find it more effective
                to sort of tip the jar of jelly over the bread and do a bit of a 
                scooping motion to slop the jelly down. Maybe use a spoon.
            </li>
            <li>
                Finally, smoosh the other piece of bread right on top and viola!
                You have your very own peanut butter and jelly sandwich!
            </li>
            <li>
                Optional last step. Repeat the process to build a double decker.
                Thank me later.
            </li>
        </ol>
