        <p class="text">
            If I'm remembering correctly, a book I once read opened my eyes to the facts: cereal is basically a lie.
            <br>
            Yup, that's right. The corn industry invented it as a way to sell more
            corn.
            <br>
            Most insidiously, they launched a deceptive ad campaign to dupe the world into
            believing breakfast is the most important meal of the day and that cereal
            is the ultimate breakfast food.
            <br>
            Well, cereal may be a lie, but it's a delicious
            one. Peep the recipe below.
        </p>

        <h3 class="head">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="text">
            <li>
                Your favorite cereal
            </li>
            <li>
                Your favorite milk or milk alternative
            </li>
            <li>
                Seriously, that's it
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="head">Steps</h3>
        <ol class="text">
            <li>
                Pull your favorite bowl out of the ole cabinet. The bigger, the better.
            </li>
            <li>
                Yank your favorite cereal right off the pantry shelf. I'm partial to anything
                with loads of sugar. Bonus points for fun shapes. Pour cereal into bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reach in the fridge for any kind of milk or milk like product you have on hand.
                We always seem to have almond milk, but in my youth I was a two percenter.
                Pour the milk over the mound of cereal from the previous step.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stick a spoon in there and eat up. At the end, you can slurp up the sugary milk.
                It's a bonus that caps off a truly delicious meal.
            </li>
        </ol>
